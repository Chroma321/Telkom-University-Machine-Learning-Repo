    "### 1. **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning**: When I have the \"answers\" (labels) in my training data\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predicting categories - like \"Is this email spam or not?\" or \"Is this a cat or dog?\"\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predicting numbers - like house prices, stock values, or temperatures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning**: When I don't have labels and need to find hidden patterns\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Grouping similar things together (like customer segments)\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying complex data while keeping the important stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Batch vs Online Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Learning**: I train my model once using all available data (like studying for an exam with all materials at once)\n",
    "**Online Learning**: My model learns continuously as new data comes in (like learning from daily experiences)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Instance-based vs Model-based Learning**\n",

    "\n",
    "From studying Chapter 1, I learned about the common pitfalls in ML that I need to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Not Having Enough Data**\n",
    "- Most ML algorithms are data-hungry - they need thousands or even millions of examples\n",
    "- Sometimes getting more data is better than trying a fancier algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **My Training Data Doesn't Represent Reality**\n",
    "- If my training data isn't representative of what I'll encounter in real life, my model will fail\n",
    "- **Sampling bias**: This happens when my sample is too small or I collect data in a biased way\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Messy, Poor-Quality Data**\n",
    "- Missing values, outliers, and noisy data can ruin my model\n",
    "- Wrong or inconsistent labels are also a big problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Using Irrelevant Features**\n",
    "- **Feature selection**: I need to pick the most useful features for my problem\n",
    "- **Feature extraction**: Sometimes I can combine existing features to create better ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Overfitting - When My Model Memorizes Instead of Learning**\n",
    "- My model works great on training data but fails on new data\n",
    "- Solutions: regularization, get more training data, use a simpler model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Underfitting - When My Model is Too Simple**\n",
    "- My model is too basic to capture the underlying patterns\n",
    "- Solutions: use a more complex model, add better features, reduce constraints\n",
