1. Main Objective																
The goal of this individual task is to enhance your practical knowledge of both machine learning and deep learning by working on end-to-end projects.																
																
2. Task Overview																
"In this assignment, you will develop end-to-end machine learning and deep learning models using the provided dataset. 
This includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and comparison of performance across traditional machine learning models and deep learning architectures. 
Your task is to build a comprehensive pipeline and analyze the results to draw meaningful conclusions."																
																
3. Submission Components:																
"a. Upload on GitHub
Ensure all your code and files are uploaded to a GitHub repository."																
"b. Create Separate Repositories
For Machine Learning class: Create a repository specifically for your ML-related tasks and code. (ex: midterm-machine-learning)
For Deep Learning class: Create a separate repository for your DL-related tasks and code. (ex: midterm-deep-learning)
If you are enrolled in both classes, make sure you create two separate repositories, one for ML and one for DL."																
"c. Include Jupyter Notebooks with Explanations
Upload each Jupyter notebook that contains your code and results.
Provide clear explanations and comments in the notebooks for each step of the process (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, etc.)."																
"d. README.md for Repository Explanation (generate README.md using your favorite LLMs for better structure)
Include a README.md file in each repository that explains:
The purpose of the repository.
A brief overview of the project.
Description of the models and matrix results used.
How to navigate through the github/notebooks.
Your identification(Name,Class,NIM)"																
																
"4. Deadline:  All repositories must be fully submitted before 6 Desember 2025
*No late submissions will be accepted.*"																
																
																
																
DATASETS OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION FOR MACHINE LEARNING CLASS AND DEEP LEARNING - INDIVIDUAL TASK																
“HANDS-ON END-TO-END MODELS MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING"																
																
																
1. Main Objective																
To design and implement an end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipeline that can predict the probability of an online transaction being fraudulent																
																
2. Task Overview:																
"In this assignment, you will build an end-to-end fraud detection, You will work with both the transaction and identity tables, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, 
handle missing values and class imbalance, and engineer or select relevant features. You are required to implement machine learning or deep learning models 
to predict the probability that a transaction is fraudulent (isFraud). The workflow should cover data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning (at a basic level), evaluation using appropriate metrics"																
																
3. Link Datasets:																
Transcation Dataset																
"train_transaction.csv
Contains labeled transaction data used for model training and evaluation.
Each row represents one online transaction, described by many features (amount, time, product code, card information, address, etc.), 
plus a binary label isFraud indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)."																
"test_transaction.csv
Contains unlabeled transaction data with the same feature columns as train_transaction except isFraud.
This file is used as input to the trained model to generate fraud probability predictions, which are then written to a submission file (TransactionID, isFraud)"

DATASETS OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION FOR MACHINE LEARNING CLASS AND DEEP LEARNING - INDIVIDUAL TASK																
“HANDS-ON END-TO-END MODELS MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING"																
																
																
1. Main Objective																
"To design and implement an end-to-end regression pipeline (using machine learning and/or deep learning) 
that can predict a continuous target value from the input features (for example, the release year of a song)."																
																
2. Task Overview:																
"In this assignment, you will build an end-to-end regression model. You will work with the provided dataset, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, 
handle missing values and outliers, and engineer or select relevant features. You are required to implement machine learning or deep learning regression
 algorithms to predict the target variable. The workflow should include data preprocessing, model training, basic hyperparameter tuning, 
and evaluation using appropriate regression metrics (such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, or R²), along with a brief interpretation of the results."																
																
3. Link Datasets:																
Regresi Dataset																
"midterm-regresi-dataset.csv
The first value in each row (for example, 2001) is the target label — it tells us the year the song was released.

All the other numbers in that row (like 49.94357, 21.47114, 73.0775, ...) are features that describe the audio of the song.
These are numeric values computed from the music signal (things like timbre and other audio characteristics), 
but they don’t have simple, human-friendly names, so we usually just call them feature_1, feature_2, ..., etc."

DATASETS OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION FOR MACHINE LEARNING CLASS  - INDIVIDUAL TASK																
“HANDS-ON END-TO-END MODELS MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING"																
																
																
1. Main Objective																
design and implement a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline dedicated to a clustering task.																
																
2. Task Overview:																
"In this assignment, you will build a customer clustering pipeline. You will use a customer dataset, clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values and outliers, and prepare useful features. 
Then you will apply unsupervised learning methods (such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN) to group customers based on their spending and payment behavior. 
Your workflow should include data preprocessing, model training, choosing the number of clusters, evaluating the clusters, and explaining what each cluster represents."																
																
3. Link Datasets:																
Clustering Dataset																
"clusteringmidterm.csv
This dataset contains information about each customer’s credit card usage and payment behavior. 
CUST_ID is the unique ID for each customer. 
BALANCE shows the customer’s current or average outstanding balance on the card, 
while BALANCE_FREQUENCY indicates how often this balance is updated or changes over time. 
PURCHASES is the total amount the customer has spent using the card,
 with ONEOFF_PURCHASES capturing large, one-time purchases and 
INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES capturing purchases paid in multiple installments. 
CASH_ADVANCE represents the total amount of cash the customer has withdrawn using the card. 
The variables PURCHASES_FREQUENCY, ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY, and PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY describe how often the customer makes purchases in general, as one-off payments, or as installments.
 CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY and CASH_ADVANCE_TRX describe how often and how many times the customer takes cash advances, 
while PURCHASES_TRX is the number of purchase transactions. 
CREDIT_LIMIT is the maximum amount of credit available to the customer. 
PAYMENTS shows how much the customer has paid back, 
and MINIMUM_PAYMENTS is the total of the minimum required payments they have made. 
PRC_FULL_PAYMENT indicates how often the customer pays their full balance (as a proportion of months), 
and TENURE shows how long (in months) the customer has had the card or account."
